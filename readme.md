# Welcome to versa-stack

versa-stack is a project aimed at providing simple, configurable tools for developing, building, and deploying arbitrary applications. The stack includes a command-line interface (CLI) and a Kubernetes operator that can be used to plan and execute pipelines, run them on localhost, Docker containers, or Kubernetes clusters, and extend their functionality with plugins.

Configurability is a key feature of versa-stack. The tools are configured using processed configuration files that allow you to tailor their behavior to your specific needs. The stack also includes a plugin system that allows you to extend the functionality of the tools as needed.
